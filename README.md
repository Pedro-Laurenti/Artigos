### For Multiple Author 
I've added a multiple-author feature to my personal blog website to make it easier for those who want to start blogging with their friends or others without the need for extensive development and design work. The website is built using Next.js v13 and Sanity v3, making it a ready-to-use blogging platform.

As part of this enhancement, I'd like to customize the hero section and navigation bar of the website to better fit your specific needs. If the website contains more than one author, it's essential to modify the hero section accordingly.

All other functionalities and pages have already been created and are fully functional. To showcase this multiple-author feature, you can take a look at an example on the single article page where I've included an author card. This card features three buttons, and when you click on any of them, you'll be directed to a new page that displays content specific to the selected author. This functionality operates by extracting the author's unique identifier from the URL, ensuring that the content is presented accordingly.
